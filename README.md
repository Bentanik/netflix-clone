# Netflix Clone — Microservices Architecture

A full-stack **Netflix Clone** project built with **.NET 8**, **React/Next.js**, and a **Microservices Architecture**.

This repository (`netflix-clone`) serves as the **main entry point** — managing all submodules (services, gateway, frontend, etc.) and providing documentation for the overall system.

### Objectives

- Build a **distributed, event-driven** architecture.
